This is a personal portfolio page created in React.js. I used a handful of plugins to make it a bit more pretty, and to show off some of my web projects I have worked on, my resume and some other professional work. I figured it was a cooler way to display my resume and other things for potential employers, and freinds to view my work. I would like to give a shout out to FroDev on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE7Y95L1btz6qQkfyFfYFQA/) who created a tutorial on his own personal portfolio. I used his outline and videos to create this project.
